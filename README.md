# ReP
**Re**petative **P**ipettor

## Background
The ReP was created to automate repetative pipetting tasks in a simple and cost-effective way. It utilizes a rack and pinion design to move the pipette's plunger up and down. It can be dialed in and calibrated to aspirate and dispense at any given rate, frequency, and volume. It is intended to be held upright with a ring stand clamp or any other clamped arm to allow for easy maneuverability and adaptability. The ReP is built around an Eppendorf pipette. The DC motor is controlled with a Raspberry Pi Nano and an L298N motor controller. The structure itself is 3D printed from PLA.

## Included
In this repository, I have included:
1. STL files for the 3D prints,
2. construction and wiring guides, and
3. the code for the raspberry pi

## 1. 3D Printing
There are seven total pieces that need to be printed: *axle_extension, clip_side1_c, clip_side2_c, housing, motor_holder, pinion,* and *rack_assembly.* None of the pieces require any special printing instructions. PLA is the recommended material given its structural stability and cost. Support material will be required. 20% infill and 0.2 layer height is adequate.

## 2. Construction and Wiring
