# STL files

The provided STL files are all required to be printed once to create the ReP. These STL files can be uploaded into any 3D printing program for plate placement and slicing. I recommend PLA as the printing material and no special printing instructions are necessary. Defaults of 20% inful and .2 layer height can be used. All of these files were originally created using Solidworks.
